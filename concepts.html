                        <p>Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to 
                            capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present 
                            spatial or geographic data. 
                            GIS applications are tools that allow users to create 
                            interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, 
                            edit data in maps, and present the results of all these operations.</p>

                                                        A polyline is composed of a sequence of two or more coordinate pairs called vertices. A vertex is defined by coordinate pairs, just like a point, but what differentiates a vertex from a point is its explicitly defined relationship with neighboring vertices. A vertex is connected to at least one other vertex.

                                                            A polygon is composed of three or more line segments whose starting and ending coordinate pairs are the same. Sometimes  the words lattice or area used in lieu of ‘polygon’. Polygons represent both length (i.e. the perimeter of the area) and area. They also embody the idea of an inside and an outside; in fact, the area that a polygon encloses is explicitly defined in a GIS environment. If it isn’t, then the shape is a polyline feature. Think of three connected lines defining a triangle: they can represent three connected road segments (thus polyline features), or they can represent the grassy strip enclosed by the connected roads (in which case an ‘inside’ is implied thus defining a polygon).

                                                        The cylinder can be tangent to the equator or it can be oblique. A special case is the Transverse aspect which is tangent to lines of longitude. This is a popular projection used in defining the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and State Plane coordinate systems.

Devised in 1805 by German cartographer Heinrich C. Albers, it is also known as the Albers equal-area projection.

It’s important to note that the UTM PCS is broken down into zones and therefore limits its extent to these zones that are 6° wide. For example, the State of Maine (USA) uses the UTM coordinate system (Zone 19 North) for most of its statewide GIS maps. Most USGS quad maps are also presented in a UTM coordinate system. Popular datums tied to the UTM coordinate system in the US include NAD27 and NAD83. There is also a WGS84 based UTM coordinate system.

                                                    A geographic coordinate system is a reference system for identifying locations on the curved surface of the earth. Locations on the earth’s surface are measured in angular units from the center of the earth relative to two planes: the plane defined by the equator and the plane defined by the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich England). A location is therefore defined by two values: a latitudinal value and a longitudinal value.
