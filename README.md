# GIS_Investigate_KW
Using data from Kitchener GeoHub, I will be investigating various interesting aspects of the geospatial data available

## 1: Emergency Services Against Population

- Goal: Investigate how the Emergency Services are spread out in the KW region and compare against the Population census data from 2011.

- Method: 
* Filter Emergency Services by medical, police, and fire, and for each create voronoi polygons.
* Compare against aspects of population data and comment on whether the locations of Emergency Services are well distributed.
