                    <p>The base layer consists of an open street map.
                        Emergency medical services such as hospitals, Urgent Care centers, Walk-in clinics and Emergency Ambulance services
                        have been isolated and are displayed as points on the map, with topo hospital symbology.
                        The Voronoi polygons are created using the QGIS processing tools and are displayed
                        as transparent polygons with red borders.
                    </p>
                    <p>A layer showing the Planning Communities of the Kitchener-Waterloo Region is superimposed
                        with a semi-transparent layer to show the demarkation of the localities. This helps in identifying
                        the distribution of the Emergency Medical Services in the region.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, a heatmap is generated based on the estimated number of emergency room physicians
                        in attendance at each facility. The heatmap is displayed with a colour ramp from green to red,
                        with green indicating a higher number of physicians and red indicating a lower number of physicians.
                        This layer is also used to label the facilities.
                    </p>
                    <p> The QGIS tools used include "voronoi polygons" from vector geometry, and "clip vector by mask layer". A 
                        <a href="./../webmap/qgis2web_2024_11_21-07_39_18_371738/index.html"> webmap </a> 
                        was created using the QGIS2WEB plugin for interactive interface.

                    <h2 class="h2">Data used for the project and how they were transformed.</h2>
                    <p> All data, other than the open street map, was obtained from 
                        <a href="https://open-kitchenergis.opendata.arcgis.com/pages/open-data-listing">Kitchener GeoHub</a>
                        and modified to suit the requirements of the project. 
                        The data was transformed using QGIS processing tools and the attribute tables.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="h2">Analysis and results of the project.</h2>
                    <p>The voronoi polynomials can be used to determine the nearest emergency services center
                        for a given location. The heatmap can be used to identify areas that are underserved by emergency
                        medical services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on the extend of the voronoi polygons, as well as the heatmap,
                        it can be seen that the emergency medical services fairly concentrated in the urban areas
                        of the city of Kitchener. However, as one moves south past Huron Park and Pioneer Park,
                        towards Doon South, Huron South, South Plains, Dundee and close to the City of Cambridge,
                        the density of emergency medical services decreases, and the distance to the nearest emergency
                        service center increases.
                    </p>
                    <p> A key identification of this project is therefore the need to build more emergency medical
                        centers in the southern regions of the city of Kitchener. This will ensure a well-distributed network
                        of emergency medical services, and that all residents have access to emergency medical care on time.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="h2">Challenges faced with the project.</h2>
                    <p>The greatest challenge faced in this project was obtaining data on the number
                        of emergency room physicians in attendance at each facility. A request for the data was made
                        was made to the city of Kitchener, but the data was not available. As a result, the heatmap is based
                        on an estimated number of physicians in attendance at each facility obtained by visiting individual 
                        facility websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A second challenge was parsing the demographic data of the city of Kitchener to identify areas that
                        may need extra attention in terms of emergency medical services. The data, while available, was hard to
                        interpret due to lack of proper labelling and was not used in the final project. This may be revisited in the future.
