                        an increase in vegetation health. The color gradient gives a sense of the mapping

                        The project used QGIS to process the data and create the NDVI map. 
                        Satellite images with the red and near-infrared bands were used to calculate the NDVI 
                        using the raster calculator in QGIS. Indiviual NDVI images from August and October were 
                        then used to note the difference in vegetation health, and to
                        calculate the difference in NDVI between the two months.

                    <p> All data was obtained from Landsat 8 satellite images. 
                        The images were downloaded from the <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/">USGS Earth Explorer website</a> . 
                        The images were then processed in QGIS to create the NDVI maps.

                    <h2 class="h2">Analysis and results of the project.</h2>
                    <p>
                        The NDVI map was used to identify the vegetation cover in the Region of Waterloo.
                        The map can be used to identify areas where the vegetation is significantly affected by the impending Winter.
                        While the map shows how the vegetation health has changed, it is important to recognize that this is based on
                        data from a single year. In genral, the vegetation health of the region is expected to change with the seasons,
                        however, the severity may depend on many factors such as temperature and humidity change, elevation of the region,
                        the number of cloudy days in that Fall season, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further analysis can be done to identify the factors that affect the vegetation health in the Region of Waterloo.
                        The region of interest can be increased to include nearby localities, and the elevation profiles can be used to
                        compare the vegetation health at different altitudes. The NDVI map can also be constructed across multiple years
                        to identify the long-term changes in vegetation health and other factors that may affect Fall foliage.

                    <h2 class="h2">Challenges faced with the project.</h2>
                    <p> 
                        The main challenge faced with the project was the limitation of the Landsat 8 satellite images.
                        The specific requirements of a maximum of 10% cloud cover and the availability of the images for the specific region
                        posed significant limitations on the data available for the project. 
                        Moreover, there is no guarantee that similar images will be available for the same region in the subsequent years.
                        Perhaps a better source for such images will be a geostationary satellite that can provide images of the same region
                        across multiple years.
